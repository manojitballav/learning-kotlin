# learning-kotlin
This repo will contain all the program that I create while learning KOTLIN
## Notes
* KOTLIN extension: "filename.kt"
* Don't have to write everything inside class as in JAVA, In KOTLIN you can write functions outside and KOTLIN will compile it to class format

### writing a function
* to create a function we will have to use the 'fun' keyword followed by the function name.
* In KOTLIN the argument name comes before the type of the arguments
fun main(args: Array<String>)
* The above code creates a main function which accepts array of strings as arguments
* So no huge print statements like 'Sytem.out.println()', instead just write ' print "statements" '
